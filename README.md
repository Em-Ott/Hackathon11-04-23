# Hackathon11-04-23
A small basic game in JavaScript made for GU's 2023 Hackathon which I attended for six hours. <br>
Walking into GU's Hackathon with no team and very little coding experience I knew I wanted to create a very basic game which would have a few things: <br>
-One sprite that would move without player control and a sprite that the player could control. <br>
-Accurate HP bars that would be effected by collision or attacks. <br>
-Incorporate outside images with the game. <br>
-Have the non-player sprite slowly ramp up over time with speed or special mechanics. <br>
I figured that surely with six hours I could figure out enough JavaScript to learn how to do this. I accomplished the first three but ran out of time before I could finish the fourth. Here I will detail what I learned how to do, and how I would've accomplished the fourth task. <br>
What I learned: <br>
-Classes, how to give them parameters and adjust these parameters with each individual variable. <br>
-Functions, how to locally declare variables and when, and how to have a continuously looping function for animating the sprites. <br>
-Write reactions to user input using switch statements. <br>
-If statements to determine whether or not sprites show up depending on their HP value. <br>
How I would've accomplished the fourth task if I had time: <br>
-I would've used the variable mobSlain and after each time the mob's health point reached 0 I would've checked if it were over a certain number. <br>
-Depending on if it was over the number I would've decreased it's x.velocity to -5, -7, etc. And would also set the level equal to 2, 3, etc. in the same if statement. <br>
This is the finished result.
