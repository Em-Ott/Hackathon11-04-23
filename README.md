# Hackathon11-04-23
A small basic game in JavaScript made for GU's 2023 Hackathon which I attended for six hours. <br>
Walking into GU's Hackathon with no team and very little coding experience I knew I wanted to create a very basic game which would have a few things: <br>
<li> One sprite that would move without player control and a sprite that the player could control. </li><br>
<li> Accurate HP bars that would be effected by collision or attacks. </li><br>
<li> Incorporate outside images with the game. </li> <br>
<li> Have the non-player sprite slowly ramp up over time with speed or special mechanics. </li> <br>
I figured that surely with six hours I could figure out enough JavaScript to learn how to do this. I accomplished the first three but ran out of time before I could finish the fourth. Here I will detail what I learned how to do, and how I would've accomplished the fourth task. <br>
What I learned: <br>
<li> <strong>Classes</strong>, how to give them parameters and adjust these parameters with each individual variable. </li><br>
<li> <strong>Functions</strong>, how to locally declare variables and when, and how to have a continuously looping function for animating the sprites. </li> <br>
<li>Write <strong>reactions</strong> to <strong>user input</strong> using <strong>switch statements</strong>. </li><br>
<li> <strong>If statements</strong> to determine whether or not sprites show up depending on their HP value. </li><br>
How I would've accomplished the fourth task if I had time: <br>
<li> I would've used the variable mobSlain and after each time the mob's health point reached 0 I would've checked if it were over a certain number. </li><br>
<li> Depending on if it was over the number I would've decreased it's x.velocity to -5, -7, etc. And would also set the level equal to 2, 3, etc. in the same if statement. </li><br>
This is the finished result.
